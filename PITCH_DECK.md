## Problem Statement

### The Traditional DeFi Experience

**Complexity & Fragmentation**
- Users navigate 5-10 different protocols for a single strategy
- Each platform has different UI/UX (Uniswap, Curve, Lido, etc.)
- Average trade takes 10-15 minutes for power users
- 90% of retail users can't access advanced features

**High Barrier to Entry**
- Steep learning curve (APY, slippage, gas limits, MEV)
- Risk of catastrophic mistakes (sending to wrong address)
- No built-in portfolio analysis or risk management
- Requires technical expertise to optimize transactions

**Market Size**
- **$14B+** annual volume on Solana DEXs alone
- **200M+** crypto wallets globally
- **<10%** adoption among retail investors

### Customer Pain Points

1. **Time**: Multi-step operations take too long
2. **Cost**: Poor execution due to lack of optimization knowledge
3. **Risk**: Portfolio concentration without warnings
4. **Access**: Mobile trading nearly impossible
5. **Intimidation**: Technical jargon scares away mainstream users
